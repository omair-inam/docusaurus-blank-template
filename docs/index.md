# Introduction
This is a repository of my thoughts and notes on various topics related to tech. It's inspired by [Hynek Schlawack's TIL](https://hynek.me/til/)

## Motivation
I'd like to share tidbits of knowledge with the hope that they may prove useful to my future self and, perhaps, at least
one other soul out there.

After creating [a blog](https://www.omairinam.com) and spending an unhealthy amount of time and energy on how it looks,
whilst only successfully manage to create a single post, I've decided I should at least document what I've learned.
